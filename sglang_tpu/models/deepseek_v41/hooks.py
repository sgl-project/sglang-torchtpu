"""DeepSeek-V4.1 TPU runtime hooks (compress ratios 0/1/2).

Every hook here passes V4 (no ratio-1/2 layers, model_type != deepseek_v41)
through to ``original``. They are appended after sglang_tpu/hooks/dsv4.py so
that, on shared targets, they are the outer wrapper.

build_tpu_dsv41_kv_pool, get_tpu_dsv41_bytes_per_swa_token,
get_tpu_dsv41_bytes_per_full_token
  Why: KVCacheConfigurator._build_dsv4_kv_pool hardcodes DeepSeekV4TokenToKVPool
       and the V4 TPU hook rebinds it to DSV4TPUTokenToKVPool, which rejects
       ratios 1/2; DSV4PoolConfigurator budgets FlashMLA bytes per token.
  How: AROUND the three targets, bodies in
       sglang_tpu.models.deepseek_v41.memory_pool (owned by the pool module).
  Upstream PR or issue: not filed (V4.1 TPU bring-up, PR1).
  Remove when: KVCacheConfigurator and DSV4PoolConfigurator query
       current_platform for the DSV4 pool class and its byte sizing.

select_tpu_dsv41_loader
  Why: RunaiModelStreamerLoader reads every routed expert on every rank; under
       EP8 each rank keeps 1/8 of them, so startup reads ~8x the bytes it needs.
       The loader has no model-owned tensor selection seam.
  How: AFTER get_model_loader swaps in DSV41RunaiModelStreamerLoader for the
       V4.1 target only; it inherits construction, loading and postprocessing.
  Upstream PR or issue: not filed (forked from sgl-project/sglang-torchtpu#1744).
  Remove when: the core loader accepts a model-owned checkpoint tensor filter.

load_tpu_dsv41_engram_rows
  Why: EngramEmbedding._load_rows slices its TP row range out of the full
       ~100 GB table, so the loader must hand it the whole table. The V4.1
       loader reads only this rank's rows (one contiguous range, concurrent
       pread), which the original would slice a second time.
  How: AROUND EngramEmbedding._load_rows; tensors tagged with ROW_START_ATTR
       are copied as-is after a row-range check, others take the original path.
  Upstream PR or issue: not filed (V4.1 TPU bring-up, PR1).
  Remove when: EngramEmbedding accepts a pre-sliced row range.
trace_tpu_platform_fact
  Why: the V4.1 shifted-mHC loop in DeepseekV4Model reads
       get_platform().is_blackwell inside the compiled forward;
       PlatformContext.__getattr__ uses object.__getattribute__, which Dynamo
       cannot trace, so torch.compile fails during TPU warmup.
  How: AROUND PlatformContext.__getattr__ resolves the fact through a
       torch._dynamo.assume_constant_result helper; facts are fixed once the
       process starts, before any model is traced.
  Upstream PR or issue: not filed (V4.1 TPU bring-up, PR1).
  Remove when: PlatformContext is Dynamo-traceable or V4.1 forward reads
       platform facts outside the compiled region.
